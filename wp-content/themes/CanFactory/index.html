          The Old American Can Factory is an historic, six-building, 130,000 sq ft industrial complex on the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn that houses a curated community of more than 300 artisans, visual/performing artists, poets/writers, filmmakers, architects/designers, publishers, non-profit
            organizations and others working in the creative industries.
        </p> 
        <p>
          The (OA) Can Factory was built in phases between c. 1879 and 1910.  In 1996, X&#216; Projects Inc (X&#216;p) took over management of the complex and curating its tenants, and in 2003 began the physical re-development of all its buildings to serve the cultural community.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 1996 through 2012, X&#216;p produced &/or presented hundreds of site-specific performances, exhibitions and cultural events in and around The (OA) Can Factory, often in partnership with other organizations, to audiences totaling more than 100,000 persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2013, X&#216;p began a comprehensive visioning and planning process to grow the complex and build more than 200,000 sq ft to accommodate new programming and expanded facilities. The new complex will be known as <span class="bold-text">INDUSTRIANA</span><span class="symbol">&#x00AE;</span>GC at The (OA) Can Factory.
